          <p>The Core Processing Unit (CPU) is often referred to as the brains of the computer.
            While the CPU only makes up one of many processing units, it is one of the most important.
            It is the part of a computer that performs calculations, actions, and runs programs.
            The CPU takes instructional inputs from the computer's RAM, decodes and processes the action,
            before delivering an output. CPUs are in all sorts of devices ranging from computers and laptops,
            to smartphones, tablets, and smart TVs. The small and usually square chip is placed onto the device's
            motherboard and interacts with the other hardware to operate your computer.</p>

          <p>A CPU cooler is device designed to draw heat away from the system CPU and other components in the enclosure.
             Using a CPU cooler to lower CPU temperatures improves efficiency and stability of the system. Adding a cooling device,
             however, can increase the overall noise level of the system.</p>
          <p>The CPU cooler may consist of a heat sink (a component designed to lower the
             temperature of an electronic device by dissipating heat into the surrounding air)
             or combination of a heat sink and fan. These cooling systems are generally referred to
             as air cooling and are often used in conjunction with systems that are designed to improve airflow.</p>

          <img src="assets/mb.jpg" alt=""style="height:auto; max-width:100%; width:500px; float: left; padding:20px;">
          <p>You don't have to hang out with tech professionals all day to have heard the term
             "motherboard." This critical component of the modern PC plays an important role in
             keeping your computer running. But what does a motherboard do? How can you make sure
              it's functioning correctly? Is it possible to replace it yourself? We answer all
               your motherboard-related questions in this simple guide.</p>
               <p>The official motherboard definition is that it’s the main printed circuit board within a computer,
                  which means it’s the primary piece of circuitry that all of the other pieces plug into to create a cohesive whole.

          <h1>POWER SUPPLY</h1>
          <img src="assets/psu.png" alt=""style="height:auto; max-width:100%; width:500px; float: right;; padding:20px;">
          <p>The power supply unit is the piece of hardware that converts the power provided from the outlet into usable power for the many parts inside the computer case.
            It converts the alternating current from your wall outlet into a continuous form of power called direct current that the computer components require. It also
             regulates overheating by controlling voltage, which might change automatically or manually depending on the power supply.</p>
            <p>The power supply unit is mounted just inside the back of the case. If you follow the computer's power cable,
               you'll find that it attaches to the back of the power supply. It's the backside that's usually the only portion of the power supply that most people will ever see.

          <img src="assets/ram.jpg" alt=""style="height:auto; max-width:100%; width:500px; float: right;; padding:20px;">
          <p>RAM takes the form of computer chips — integrated circuits — that are either soldered directly onto the main
            logic board of your computer or installed in memory modules that go in sockets on your computer’s logic board.
             RAM stands for Random Access Memory. The data stored in RAM can be accessed almost instantly regardless of where
              in memory it is stored, so it’s very fast — milliseconds fast. RAM has a very fast path to the computer’s CPU,
              or central processing unit, the brain of the computer that does most of the work. RAM is random access as opposed
              to sequential access. Data that’s accessed sequentially includes stuff that’s written to your hard disk drive.

          <p>The graphics processing unit, or GPU, has become one of the most important types of computing technology,
            both for personal and business computing. Designed for parallel processing, the GPU is used in a wide range of
            applications, including graphics and video rendering. Although they’re best known for their capabilities in gaming,
             GPUs are becoming more popular for use in creative production and artificial intelligence (AI).
            GPUs were originally designed to accelerate the rendering of 3D graphics. Over time, they became more flexible and
            programmable, enhancing their capabilities. This allowed graphics programmers to create more interesting visual effects
             and realistic scenes with advanced lighting and shadowing techniques. </p>

          <p>The computer case serves mainly as a way to physically mount and contain all of the actual
            components inside of a computer, like the motherboard, hard drive, optical drive, floppy disk drive, etc.
            They typically come bundled with a power supply.The housing of a laptop, netbook, or tablet is also considered
             a case but since they aren't purchased separately or very replaceable, the computer case tends to refer to the one that's part of a traditional desktop PC.
            Some popular computer case manufacturers include Xoxide, NZXT, and Antec.</p>
            <p>Motherboards, computer cases, and power supplies all come in different sizes called form factors. All three must be compatible to work properly together.

          <img src="assets/ssd.jpg" alt=""style="height:auto; max-width:100%; width:500px; float:left; padding:20px;">
          <p>For decades, data was stored primarily on mechanical hard drives. These traditional hard disk drives (HDDs) are mostly based on moving parts,
             like a read/write head that goes back and forth to gather data. This makes HDDs the likeliest computer hardware component to fail.
            The new solid-state drives work completely differently. They use a simple memory chip called NAND flash memory, which has no moving parts and near-instant access times.
            Early experiments with SSD-like technology started in the 1950s, and by the 1970s and 1980s they were being used in high-end supercomputers.
            However, the technology was extremely expensive, and the storage capacity was small (2MB-20MBs) compared to the ludicrous 5-digit prices.
            In the early 1990s, hardware innovations caused SSD prices to drop. However, the lifespan and size were still an issue: An SSD had a lifespan
            of roughly 10 years. </p>
